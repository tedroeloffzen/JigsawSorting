# JigsawSorting
Simple JavaFX Application that can create a series of random Integers and than sorts them according to the sorting algorthims that are provided through Java 9 Modules 

The `run.sh` script builds the modules and runs them from the 'exploded' module format.

The `jar-run.sh` script builds modular jars and runs the application from these jars.
